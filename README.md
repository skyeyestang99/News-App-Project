This is a single page web application that allows users to read daily news from New York Times and Guardians.
• Implemented using React and Bootstrap to support its front-end where readers can view categorized sections, switch to news
outlets they want to read, push comments, and search for keywords.
• Implemented Node.js and Express to support a servlet as back-end, called Guardian API and NYTimes API in
back-end.
